Accuknox DevOps Trainee Practical Assessment – Final Submission

Problem Statement 1: Containerization and Deployment of Wisecow Application
Objective:
Containerize and deploy the Wisecow application on Kubernetes with secure TLS communication and automated CI/CD pipeline.

Repository: https://github.com/Ravi-Teja4/wisecow
Approach Taken:

Dockerization:

Developed a Dockerfile for building the Wisecow application container image.

Image was tested locally and pushed to AWS ECR.

Kubernetes Deployment:

Crafted Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml, ingress.yaml) to deploy Wisecow in EKS.

Exposed the application using a LoadBalancer service.

TLS Implementation:

Secured the application using AWS ACM for HTTPS with the domain devopswithravi.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Created a GitHub Actions workflow to automate:

Building and pushing Docker images to ECR.

Optional: Automatically deploying the updated image to Kubernetes after successful builds.
Outcome:

The application is containerized and deployed securely.

TLS encryption ensures secure communication.

CI/CD pipeline enables automated builds and deployment.

Website currently inaccessible due to AWS account limits, but full deployment steps and configurations are ready.
Problem Statement 2: System & Application Monitoring

Objective:
Implement monitoring scripts to ensure the health of the system and application.

Tasks Completed:

System Health Monitoring Script:

Developed system_health_monitor.py to monitor: CPU usage, Memory usage, Disk utilization, Running processes.

Sends alerts to console/logs if thresholds are breached (e.g., CPU > 80%).

Application Health Checker:

Created a script to check the uptime and availability of the Wisecow application.

Script verifies HTTP status codes to determine if the app is 'up' or 'down'.

Outcome:

Continuous monitoring of system resources and application status.

Automatic detection of failures ensures reliability and uptime.

Problem Statement 3: Zero-Trust KubeArmor Policy (Optional / Extra Credit)

Objective:
Apply a zero-trust security policy to the deployed Kubernetes workload.

Approach Taken:

Developed a KubeArmor policy (wisecow-zero-trust.yaml) to restrict:

File access (Block all except allowed binaries)

Process execution (Block all except application binaries)

Network access (Block all except required endpoints)

Applied the policy to the Wisecow deployment.

Triggered policy violations to test the zero-trust enforcement.

Outcome:

Zero-trust security enforced at the workload level.

Policy violations captured and documented (screenshot committed to repo).

Overall Conclusion:

Wisecow application is containerized, deployed, and secured on Kubernetes with TLS encryption.

CI/CD automation ensures continuous build and deployment.

System and application health monitoring scripts provide reliable uptime and alerting.

Zero-trust KubeArmor policy enforces strong security at the workload level.

Artifacts Submitted:

Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD workflow YAML

Health monitoring scripts (system_health_monitor.py, application checker)

KubeArmor policy YAML and screenshot of policy violations
